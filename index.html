							<p>During the several years, market of online gaming rapidly expanded and reached the volume of $900 millions. After the thorough analysis of demand and competitors, we decided to reimagine the concept of User Experience and ways to develop products connected with CS:GO cases. Our audience is gamers and fans of CS:GO, who enjoy collecting game items and love to open loot boxes.</p>

							<h2>Analysis of market and competitors</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>As we’ve analyzed current situation on the market and conducted CusDev of the competitors’ clients, we came up with the following problems:</p>
							<ul class="features-list">
								<li class="features-item">complicated and unclear interfaces</li>
								<li class="features-list">no mobile or/and adaptive version of website</li>
								<li class="features-list">products don’t satisfy real needs of customers anymore</li>
								<li class="features-list">outdated technologies, consequently, no possibility for quick response to market changes</li>
								<li class="features-list">majority of big services fool their clients</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Good design of a product is a key comparative advantage for strategic development of a company existing in a highly competitive environment.</p>

							<h2>User Experience and Strategy </h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>During the development of a UX strategy and a product itself, we took into the consideration not only accessibility and simplicity of interface, but also speed of possible scalability to the size of an ecosystem.</p>
              <p>At the initial stage of design and strategy incorporation, our main goal was to implement system approach to decision-making process in order to learn ways of adapting to ever-changing market conditions, evolving with the needs of company and clients.</p>
              <p>All of the tasks connected with the UX strategy development were divided on several categories: <br>Tactic:</p>
              <ul class="features-list">
                <li class="features-item">Microinteractions</li>
                <li class="features-list">Interactions with the component</li>
                <li class="features-list">Speed of completing basic scenarios and User Flow</li>
                <li class="features-list">Responsiveness</li>
                <li class="features-list">Learning and native abilities</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Strategic:</p>
              <ul class="features-list">
                <li class="features-item">Easy scalability to the size of an ecosystem</li>
                <li class="features-list">High speed of hypotheses testing</li>
                <li class="features-list">Ability of completing Pivot, but if it is needed, the ability to keep the legacy of design system and logic of interaction</li>

							<h2>Design System</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>EZY became the initial product for testing top level hypotheses and backing them with facts. Future strategy of development implied scaling to the level of ecosystem comprised of a product line.</p>
              <p>With this in mind, we decided to incorporate component approach, create design library and UI Kit, use Sketch-Zeppelin-Reach Components development chain. Thus, it enabled to create a base for an ecosystem and increase a speed of testing and introduction of new hypotheses to the product.</p>
              <p>In order to create lively design of component system, we used React and StoryBook. It helped designers to see the work of a certain component in real conditions. This decision was also beneficial for developers who were able to synchronize their understanding of components with designers.</p>
              <p>Design system enabled to reach consistency in all units of a product. Moreover, it solved several tasks connected with the product interface: communication, learning through interaction, predictability and responsiveness.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>The underlying factor of navigational model was accessibility to core functions from anywhere on website. Taking into consideration the target audience, we used traditional game patterns of interaction with interfaces to ensure quick and smooth transition to onboarding at website.</p>

            <p>Competitors on the market didn’t focus on the development of a mobile version. For our analysis, we used data from web traffic and key search requests on the market of cases, as well as mobile traffic dynamics and potential paying capacity.  Our priority task was to create the best mobile version of this type of service in the segment.</p>

            <p>One of the most important factors that we paid attention to were microinteractions in interface as it influences greatly the loyalty and intuitive learning abilities while using the website. What’s more, all the interactions with elements on website had a response.</p>

            <h3>Components</h3>
            <p>One of the most important factors that we paid attention to were microinteractions in interface as it influences greatly the loyalty and intuitive learning abilities while using the website. What’s more, all the interactions with elements on website had a response.</p>

            <h3>Components</h3>
            <p>For the unique communication with user we came up with the image of a lightning which matched with the main competitive advantage of a product. Lightning is usually associated with high speed in everything from a work of interface to opening the cases, from upgrades to skins withdrawal. To reinforce the uniqueness and consistency of design, we developed a set of characters and own icon set.</p>

            <h3>Cases</h3>
            <p>Cases with skins were the main product of EZY, that’s why their visual uniqueness and attractiveness was one of our main goals not only in the context of website interface but in the realms of the whole market.</p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/item-card.jpg" alt="" /></span>

            <h3>Item card</h3>
            <p>One of the main elements for a user to interact with is an item card. The main difficulty connected with its development concerned the need to include all possible conditions of interface, statuses of display, scenarios of interaction with a card.</p>

            <h3>Home Page</h3>
            <p>During planning and implementation of the main page, big emphasis was made on the simplicity of navigation. In order to reach it, we divided the page on main thematic parts and components.</p>

            <h3>Open case page</h3>
            <p>Core function of a website was the ability to open cases with skins, so the priority task here was to ensure not only its visual attractiveness, but also its usability and response to the needs of customers.</p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/upgrade-gif.gif" alt="" /></span>

            <h3>Upgrade</h3>
            <p>According to the statistics, users spend most of their time on the upgrade page. The upgrade function was one the key actions on website as it served the upsell product role.</p>

            <h3>Balance replenishment and items withdrawal</h3>
            <p>Scenarios of balance replenishment and items withdrawal in Steam are the two main components of the product of this type as their elaboration and simplicity directly influence CPA, Revenue, LTV and Churn Rate.</p>

            <h3>Order a skin</h3>
            <p>The main growth point of LTV and ARPU was the function of a skin order. Important thing here was to explain and show the whole process in a clear and transparent way. Thus, we thoroughly developed all the stages of order, starting from creation of the order to withdrawal of a skin to a customer. We also integrated this process to the main User Flow.</p>
